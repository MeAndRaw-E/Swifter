1. Refactor the code in successive passes, minimizing total characters while preserving both logic and clear readability. Do not shorten any existing variable or function names; every identifier that remains must stay exactly as written.  
2. You may remove unused identifiers or inline code where possible, but anything kept must retain its original name.  
3. After each pass, output the revised code, indicate whether further reduction is possible, and either continue or stop. If you stop, briefly state why no additional shortening can be achieved.  
4. Perform at least three passes and continue as long as each new pass reduces the character count.  
5. Do NOT add any new comments.
